INTRODUCTION
You are being asked to take part this research study because you have been
diagnosed with peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Before you decide whether you
would like to take part, it is important for you to understand why the research is
being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following
information carefully. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like
more information. Take time to decide whether you want to volunteer to take part
in this study.

WHY IS THIS RESEARCH BEING DONE?
Vascular surgery is a surgical subspecialty in which arterial and venous diseases are
managed   by   medical   therapy,   minimally   invasive   procedures,   and   surgical
interventions.  These procedures are undertaken to treat PVD and improve patient’s
quality of life, pain, activity level, and preserve physical function. The purpose of
this study is to utilize a smartphone application that will allow vascular surgeons
and their patients to track health status and functional outcomes over time.

WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THIS RESEARCH?
This study is being conducted by Dr. Benjamin S. Brooke, MD, PhD, Chief of the
Division of Vascular Surgery, and the research team, at the University of Utah.

WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THIS RESEARCH?
The central goal of this project is to develop a software application for your
smartphone that can collect patient health information to help inform health
changes for patients with PVD and their providers. The smartphone application will
collect two different types of data:

1. Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs): PROMs are objective
questionnaires that represent a patient’s self-reported health without any
interpretation from a provider. PROMs can be used as surrogate measures for
outcomes that are difficult for providers to see and quantify. PROMs can be
easily administered over a smartphone application and are relatively quick
for patients to complete.
2. Passive activity: Passive activity, including number of steps walked, from
patient’s smart phone or smart watch will be shared with the application.
You will receive notification reminders within the smartphone application to re-
complete the PROMs on a monthly basis.

HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THIS RESEARCH?
The anticipated time for your participation in this research is approximately one
year, but may be longer if you continue to have symptoms of PVD that require
follow-up with the vascular surgery team. Further, we encourage you to utilize the
smartphone application for as long as you feel that it is helpful to monitor your
health status.

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS?
The risks of this study are minimal. There is the potential risk of loss of
confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep your information confidential;
however, this cannot be guaranteed. You may stop your participation in the
smartphone application at any time.

ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THIS RESEARCH?
Possible benefits may include the ability to view your own health status and
progress, as well as changes that occur over time. Knowing this valuable
information about yourself could help facilitate discussions and healthcare decisions
with your provider.

WHAT ARE THE COSTS AND COMPENSATION?
There are no costs to you for participation in this research. The smartphone
application is available for free download and participation at no cost to you. There
is no compensation for participation.

WHAT ALTERNATIVES ARE THERE TO PARTICIPATION IN THIS RESEARCH?
This is an observational research study, so your alternative to participation is not to
participate.

WHOM DO I CALL IF I HAVE QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS?
If you have questions, complaints or concerns about this study, you can contact the
Principal Investigator, Dr. Benjamin S. Brooke at 801-581-8301. You may also
contact Research Nurse, Julie Hales, at 801-587-1450.

Contact the Institutional Review Board (IRB) if you have questions regarding your
rights as a research participant. Also, contact the IRB if you have questions,
complaints or concerns which you do not feel you can discuss with the investigator.
The University of Utah IRB may be reached by phone at (801) 581-3655 or by e-mail
at irb@hsc.utah.edu.

Research Participant Advocate:  You may also contact the Research Participant
Advocate (RPA) by phone at (801) 581-3803 or by email at
participant.advocate@hsc.utah.edu.

WHAT ABOUT MY RIGHTS TO DECLINE PARTICIPATION OR WITHDRAW
FROM THIS RESEARCH?
Research studies include only people who choose to take part.  You can tell us that
you don’t want to be in this study.  You can start the study and then choose to stop
the study later.  Your decision not to participate or to withdraw from the study will
not involve any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled, and will not
affect your access to health care at The University of Utah. If you do decide to
withdraw, we ask that you contact Dr. Benjamin Brooke and let him know that you
are withdrawing. His contact information is:

Benjamin Brooke, MD, PhD
The University of Utah
Division of Vascular Surgery, Dept. of Surgery
30 North 1900 East, Room 3C344 SOM
Salt Lake City, UT 84132
Office Phone: (801) 581-8301

WHAT PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION ARE YOU ASKING ME TO PROVIDE?
The smartphone application will ask you to enter your name, phone number, and
email address. The smartphone application will ask you to indicate whether you
have arterial disease, venous disease, or both. We will keep all research records
that identify you private to the extent allowed by law. Your name will not be kept
with your responses from the PROMs nor the passive activity (i.e. number of steps
walked). In publications, your name will be removed.
Entering your name, phone number, and email address in to the smartphone
application means you allow us, the researchers in this study, and others working
with us to use some information about your health for this research study.
This is the information we will use and include in our research records:
- Demographic and identifying information: name, telephone number, and
email address
- Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and passive activity (such as
number of steps walked)

HOW WILL WE PROTECT AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?
We will do everything we can to keep your information private but we cannot
guarantee this. Study information will be kept in a secured manner and electronic
records will be password protected. Study information will not be stored with other
information in your medical record. We may also need to disclose information if
required by law.
In order to conduct this study and make sure it is conducted as described in this
form, the research records may be used and reviewed by others who are working
with us on this research:
- Members of the research team and University of Utah Health Sciences Center
- The University of Utah Institutional Review Board (IRB), which reviews
research involving people to make sure the study protects your rights;
If we share your information with groups outside of University of Utah Health
Sciences Center, we will not share your name or identifying information.  We will
label your information with a code number, so they will not know your identity.

If you do not want us to use information about your health, you should not be part
of this research. If you choose not to participate, you can still receive health care
services at University of Utah Health Sciences Center.
 
WHAT IF I DECIDE NOT TO PARTICPATE AFTER I SIGN UP FOR THE
SMARTPHONE APP?
You can tell us anytime that you do not want to be in this study and do not want us
to use your health information.  You can also tell us in writing.  If you change your
mind, we will not be able to collect new information about you, and you will be
withdrawn from the research study. However, we can continue to use information
we have already started to use in our research, as needed to maintain the integrity
of the research.

This authorization does not have an expiration date.
Thank you for your consideration to take part in this important research study";
