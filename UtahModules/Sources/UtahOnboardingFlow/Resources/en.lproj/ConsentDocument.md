**WHY IS THIS RESEARCH BEING DONE?**
Vascular surgery is a surgical subspecialty in which arterial and venous diseases are
managed   by   medical   therapy,   minimally   invasive   procedures,   and   surgical
interventions.  These procedures are undertaken to treat PVD and improve patientâ€™s
quality of life, pain, activity level, and preserve physical function. The purpose of
this study is to utilize a smartphone application that will allow vascular surgeons
and their patients to track health status and functional outcomes over time.

**WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THIS RESEARCH?**
This study is being conducted by Dr. Benjamin S. Brooke, MD, PhD, Chief of the 
Division of Vascular Surgery, and the research team, at the University of Utah. 

**WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THIS RESEARCH?**
The central goal of this project is to develop a software application for your 
smartphone that can collect patient health information to help inform health 
changes for patients with PVD and their providers. The smartphone application will 
collect two different types of data:
